\chapter{Conclusion}
In this thesis, I presented my work on creating an eye-tracking reading dataset in Romanian, developing models to predict the total reading time for words in a text, and implementing a lexical simplification pipeline that uses these models to simplify texts.

Future work could focus on several areas. First, the dataset is not yet finished, so more data could be collected from more participants with the final, correct version of the stimuli. This would improve the reliability of the dataset, which would also improve the performance of the models. Second, more work could be done on the models themselves, such as experimenting with different architectures or hyperparameters. Models could also be made to predict other eye-tracking metrics besides the total reading time, such as the number of fixations or the first fixation duration. Finally, the data and models could be used in other applications, or the lexical simplification pipeline could be extended or improved.
